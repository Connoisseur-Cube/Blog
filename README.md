Introduction:
For my final project, I chose to develop a gamer blog website using the Laravel framework. The website allows users to create accounts, log in, and engage in a variety of actions, including creating, editing, and deleting blog posts. 
Technologies Used:
1.	Laravel Framework: Laravel, an open-source PHP framework, was the core technology used for developing the website. 
2.	MySQL Database: The project utilized the MySQL database to store user information, blog posts, and related data. Laravel's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) made database management straightforward.
3.	HTML, CSS: The front-end of the website was built using HTML, CSS. I found custom CSS to be less of a hassle than bootstrap.
Features Implemented:
1.	User Authentication: The website incorporated a user authentication system, allowing users to register, log in their profiles. 
2.	Blog Management: Users could create, edit, and delete blog posts. User Profiles: Each user had a dedicated profile page where they could showcase their published blogs, view their personal information, and update their profile picture or other details.
